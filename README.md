### Things to work on:
- User profiles
- rating system
- validation for form entry
- Users being able to follow each other

### Things I would do differently:
- As I doing my project I had to change somethings because I realized that the User won't necessarily need them so I would have planned my project more from the prospective of who my audience was.
- I would have deployed to Heroku earlier as it wasn't picking up on some of seed files.

### Things I learned:
- Adding additional models after the fact is cause for disaster. I spent a good amount of time fitting errors and routes issues from this so I would plan out that part better.
